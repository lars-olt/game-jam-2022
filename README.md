## Guidelines
- Your submission must be created entirely within the allotted time frame. Exceptions to this rule are on a case-by-case basis.
- Your submission must be at least somewhat school-appropriate. That means:
- No explicit sexual imagery or pornography.
- No scenes of sexual harrasment or assault.
- No hate speech or conspiratorial rhetoric.
- No insulting, demeaning, or otherwise directly causing offense to any Cleveland student, teacher, or faculty member without their consent.
- Your art, source code, music, etc. must all be either your own creation or properly licensed (i.e. you must have the legal right to use it).
- Your submission must have at least one version that can run on either Windows 10 or a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) Exceptions to this rule are on a case-by-case basis.
- Your submission cannot contain any viruses or malware that could harm people’s systems. Basically just make it safe for people’s systems for it to be viable.
